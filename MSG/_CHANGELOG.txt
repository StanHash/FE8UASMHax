Modular Stat Getters, Version 1.1:
	CHANGED:
		- rAddFull[stat] renamed to rAddFinal[stat]
		- rNullify renamed to rNullified
		- rHalveStat renamed to rHalved
		- rShift[Left/Right] renamed to rShiftedRight[Left/Right]
		- rGetCharByte and rAddCharByte renamed to rGetCharUByte and rAddCharUByte
	
	FIXED:
		- Potential negative char con bonus not taken into account

	IMPROVED:
		- rIf is now more space efficient
		- rIf with no arguments calls condition without modifying r2, allowing for one extra passed argument
		- prAddUnitBaseCon, prAddUnitBaseMov, prAddUnitBarrierModifier and prAdjustAidIfMounted make use of macro routines instead of external asm bin
	
	ADDED:
		MSGDefinitions.event:
		- rCallSequence(seq): calls a list of routines in order (arg: list of pointers to routines, SPACE-SEPARATED)
		- rCall(rptr, arg): new variant to rCall, calls routine with r2 = arg
		- rNegated: returns (-stat)
		- rSwitchConst(trueConst, falseConst): calls following routine, then returns a constant based on that routines result
		- rGetCharSByte(offset): returns signed byte at [offset] in char struct (char struct passed through r1)
		- rGetCharWord(offset): returns word at [offset] in char struct (must be 4-aligned, useful for getting pointers)
		- rGetCharLowerHalfByte(offset): returns ((byte) [char, offset]) & 0xF
		- rGetCharUpperHalfByte(offset): returns (((byte) [char, offset])>>4) & 0xF
		- rGetSByteFrom, rGetUByteFrom, rGetWordFrom, rGetLowerHalfByteFrom, rGetUpperHalfByteFrom: same as their Char couterparts, but takes the result of following routine as struct pointer (useful for getting data from ROM Char & Class structs)
		- rGetROMChar[U/S]Byte(offset): rGet[U/S]ByteFrom(offset); rGetCharWord(0x00)
		- rGetROMClass[U/S]Byte(offset): rGet[U/S]ByteFrom(offset); rGetCharWord(0x04)
		- rAddCharSByte(offset): rAdd; rGetCharSByte(offset)
		- rNOP: Returns with doing anything (bx lr; nop)
		
		MSGConditionsRoutines.event:
		- prNot[Cond]: returns not([Cond])
		
		MSGModifierRoutines.event:
		- prAddFull[Stat]: (used to be only for mov & con) calls the corresponding getter and adds it to the stat
	
	REMOVED:
		- prAdjustMountedAid: Obsoleted, the modification now occurs within prAdjustAidIfMounted
	
	TODO:
		- prHasGuardAI and prCheckForHPCap still use external asm bin, so there is still some stuff to be made to allow them to be macro-ified.
		- modular getters for even more stuff
