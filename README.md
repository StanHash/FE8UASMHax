# Stan's (old) FE8U Asm Wizardy

This repository now only exists for historical reference. It will not get updated anymore. [FE-CHAX](https://github.com/StanHash/FE-CHAX) is where my newest stuff resides. Hacks in here that have not been ported to CHAX are also likely to be [maintained as part of the FEU Skill System](https://github.com/FireEmblemUniverse/SkillSystem_FE8).

If you have any question about anything in here, find me on the [FEU forums](https://feuniverse.us/) and [Discord](https://feuniverse.us/t/feu-discord-server/1480?u=stanh). Alternatively, if you want anything in here to be ported/updated in some way, you can open an issue in [CHAX](https://github.com/StanHash/FE-CHAX/issues) about it (CHAX being the repository that would be hosting the new port/update).
