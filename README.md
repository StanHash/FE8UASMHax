# StanH's FE8 (U) asm hacks
I made this because 1. Version control and 2. To allow other wizards to pr fixes if they feel like it.

This is the master Source repo for most of my asm hacks.

List of my hacks that are *not* included in this repository:

* [MSG (has its own repo)](https://github.com/StanHash/FE8ModularStatGetters)
* Alternative Spell Anim by Class and Range thing (was my first asm hack, and needs high amounts of reworking)
